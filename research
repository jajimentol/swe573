# Git as a version management system
======

## Git is a software tracking system, that shows the life of a software, from the very beginning to the very end.
The main purpose is to keep track of all changes by labeling every change with related keywords and dates, so that in perspect of others (or in the future),
every bit of work can be identified and distinguished easily without making too much effort.
Git allows non-linear development in a team, with branching and merging features.
Branch is a term for version labeling of a software. A branch has its own version history, separated from other branches, making it unique.
Merge is a term for mixing two branch into one, so that some parts in one branch, can also be used in the other branch. 
The most useful advantage of git is, it makes large projects maintainable, scalable and trackable.
